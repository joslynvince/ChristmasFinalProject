    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I am Joslyn Vince. I am a Junior in the School of Information.
        I made this webpage to show off some of my favorite Christmas Songs
        through this webpage. Hope you enjoy!
    </p>
    <p> 
        Below I will show some of my favorite pictures of my family and I 
        during the holidays. Growing up, my family loved Christmas and we always
        celebrated with all of my extended family.
    </p>
    <p>
        On Christmas Eve, we would stay at my house, and my mother's side of 
        the family would come over. On Christmas Day, we would travel to Canada
        to celebrate with my dads side of the family!
    </p>
